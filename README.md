# Login and Signup System

This project was my first assignment as an intern at Prodigy InfoTech. The goal was to create a login and signup system where the default page is only accessible to users who are logged in.

## Project Overview

The system is built using the MERN stack:

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express
- **Database**: MongoDB

The project is structured with separate folders for the frontend and backend to maintain a clean and organized codebase.

### Features

- User registration and authentication
- Protected routes accessible only to logged-in users
- Organized code structure with separate frontend and backend directories
